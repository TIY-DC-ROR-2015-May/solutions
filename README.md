This is a collection of good solutions to the various assignments we've received.

It is not a collection of the "right" solutions. Nor necessarily of particularly great solutions
that you should strive to emulate. They *should* however, be accessible, given what we'd seen at
the point in time when they were assigned.

Caveat emptor.
